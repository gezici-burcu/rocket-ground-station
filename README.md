# 🚀 Rocket Ground Station Interface (WPF)

A conceptual rocket ground station user interface designed to monitor and visualize telemetry data during rocket flight operations.  
This project focuses on presenting avionics data in a clear, operator-friendly, and extendable desktop application.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a rocket ground station interface is structured and how flight telemetry data can be visualized in real time.  
It is designed as a foundation for future integration with real telemetry sources and flight simulations.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Telemetry dashboard layout for flight monitoring
- Altitude and velocity visualization
- System and connection status indicators
- MVVM-based WPF architecture
- Modular and extendable UI design

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **C#**
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**
- **MVVM Architecture**

---

## 📡 Telemetry Data Displayed
- Altitude
- Velocity
- Battery status
- System state indicators
- Apogee status (planned)

---

## 🧪 Current Status
- UI layout and telemetry panels are implemented
- Data binding structure is ready for telemetry integration
- **3D rocket orientation view is planned but not yet integrated**

---

## 🗺 Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate 3D rocket model view (HelixToolkit.Wpf)
- [ ] Bind Pitch / Roll / Yaw data to 3D orientation
- [ ] Add telemetry source module (Serial / UDP)
- [ ] Implement flight data playback mode

---



## 📌 Notes
This project is intended as a learning and demonstration tool for avionics-oriented software development and ground station systems.
